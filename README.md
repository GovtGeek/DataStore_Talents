# DataStore_Talents
WoW DataStore Addon - Talents Module

DataStore_Talents is part of the DataStore series.

Its purpose is to scan and store data related to Talent trees & Glyphs for all your characters, and act as a data abstraction layer for client addons, which no longer have to scan or store this information.

More information can be found on the main page : DataStore

Specific details (usage/scope) will be posted later as separate pages on this project.
