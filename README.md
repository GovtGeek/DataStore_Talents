# DataStore_Talents

DataStore_Talents is part World of Warcraft Add-on that is part of the DataStore series.
It is compatible with all versions of the game.

Its purpose is to scan and store data related to Talent trees & Glyphs for all your characters, and act as a data abstraction layer for client addons, which no longer have to scan or store this information.
